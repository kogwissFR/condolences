- Share success stories about their careers and achievements
- Preserve the legacy of the Cognitive Science program
- Connect with fellow alumni through shared experiences

## TARGET AUDIENCE

### Primary Users
- **Alumni (Ehemalige Studierende):** Former students submitting content
- **Visitors:** Current students, faculty, prospective students, general public viewing submissions
- **Administrators:** Content moderation and website management

### User Needs

- Public display of approved submissions
- Emotional, respectful presentation befitting a memorial context
- Timeline/chronological organization (potentially by graduation year)

## TECHNICAL SCOPE

2. **Display System:** Public-facing gallery/feed of submitted content
3. **Content Management:** Admin interface for moderation/approval
4. **Preservation:** Long-term archival (project runs until 2029+)

### Language Requirements
- **Primary:** German (Kognitionswissenschaft context)
- **Optional:** English (international alumni consideration)

## PROJECT CONSTRAINTS

### Timeline
- Development: 2025-2026 (estimation needed)
- Active collection period: Until 2029
- Archival: Beyond 2029 (consider static archive solution)

### Technical Considerations
- Long-term maintenance (4+ years active use)
- Low-maintenance architecture preferred
- Accessibility requirements (academic context)
- Data privacy compliance (GDPR for German/EU alumni)

## SUCCESS CRITERIA

1. Alumni can easily submit their memories without technical barriers
2. Submissions are displayed in an emotionally appropriate, respectful manner
3. Content remains accessible throughout the phase-out period and beyond
4. Website captures and preserves the program's legacy effectively

## DECISIONS MADE ✅

1. **Moderation workflow:** Manual publication - submissions require admin approval before display
2. **Authentication:** Open to anyone - no login required (encourages broad participation)
3. **Content format:** Text-only (MVP scope, expandable later)
4. **Content acceptance:** Any success story welcome (not limited to strict definitions)
5. **Existing data:** `cond1.txt` and `cond2.txt` are placeholders for testing
6. **University integration:** Semi-official - linked from official homepage, adopts university visual style
7. **Branding requirement:** Must match official Kognitionswissenschaft homepage design

## ADDITIONAL DECISIONS ✅

8. **Content organization:** Chronological by publication date (newest first)
9. **Hosting:** GitHub Pages (static site generation, free, reliable)
10. **Official homepage:** https://uni-freiburg.de/cognition/ (style reference for branding)

## NEXT PHASE
→ **DATA.md** - Define data structures for submissions, user data, and content display
